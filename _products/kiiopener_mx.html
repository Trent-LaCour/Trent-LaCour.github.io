This CNC machined switch opener will speed up any cherry-style switch modifying project. Made out of high durability 6061 aluminum, and tumbled to a smooth finish. These are manufactured by me in Washington State USA.

All orders will ship within 1-2 business days, and will be packaged in a recyclable and biodegradable bubble mailer.

This keyswitch opener will only work on MX style housings with four tabs. It will NOT work on Alps or Kailh switches, nor will it work on switches already soldered into a board.

This <b>does</b> work on the novelkeys cream switch, however it is tighter than usual and can be difficult to use. If you'd like, I can do a simple modification to remove the alignment tabs which will let it work very well on cream switches, but will mean you must align the clips during use.
