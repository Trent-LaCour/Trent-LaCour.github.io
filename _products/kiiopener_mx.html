This CNC machined switch opener will greatly speed up any switch modifying project. Made out of high durability 6061 aluminum, and tumbled to a smooth finish. These are manufactured by me in Washington State USA.

This keyswitch opener will only work on MX style housings with four tabs. It will NOT work on Alps or Kailh switches, nor will it work on switches already soldered into a board.
